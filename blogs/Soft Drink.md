# Soft Drink Making
Since getting a soda stream a few years ago, and going through a few bottles of the proprietary syrups, I want to try and create my own. This was mainly as a learning experience, but also had some cost benefits(though not much as sugar's so expensive)
After a short amount of research online, I came across a YouTube channel called Ardon who had made an engaging video on the subject. His method seem reasonably easy, so I decided to give it a go.

## Ardon's Recipe

- 400g sugar
- zest of 3 oranges
- juice of 3 oranges
- juice of 2 tangerines
- top up with water or adjust by drinking until you have 300ml juice total

7,5g citric acid

simmer

1:10 syrup to water

While This tasted really good, it wasn't what I was looking for - almost too real. Also, there was a lot of work and preperation required to make a small batch, which I got through very quickly.
So I sought a better option.



## Art of Drink's Recipe - this is good
